'''
You are given a positive integer n.

The task is to calculate how many binary numbers without leading zeros (such that their length is n and they do not contain two zeros in a row) there are. Note that zero itself ("0") meets the conditions (for n = 1).

For example, there are three eligible binary numbers of length 3:

101
110
111
100 is not suitable.

Remember that n may be fairly big (up to 10^4). Good luck!
